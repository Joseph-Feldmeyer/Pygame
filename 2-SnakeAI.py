~~~
I have already created a basic snake game. 

Let's try to clean up the Snake game code. 
Then, I will also add a Neural Network to control the snake 

Draft: 
- class Snake 
- class Snack 
- def drawWindow 
- def playGame


* Create a NN class file: 
NN will consist of: 
    * 4x4 = 16 inputs: 
    * 20 + 20 hidden neurons 
    * 4 key press outputs 
- class NN 
-- def init 
-- def ?????
